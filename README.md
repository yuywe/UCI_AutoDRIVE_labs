### Installing uv

First, install uv, the Python package manager used by the UCI team.

#### Macos and Linux

curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

#### Windows

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Running example_f1tenth.py

UV will automatically download the correct Python version and the required packages in a virtual environment managed by UV. Therefore, please refrain from using pip or venv on top of UV. Now you are ready to run example_f1tenth.py! Restart your terminal, then run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uci-f1tenth/UCI_AutoDRIVE_labs
cd UCI_AutoDRIVE_labs
uv run example_f1tenth.py
```

### Connecting to AutoDRIVE

While `example_f1tenth.py` is running, open the AutoDRIVE application. Then click on "Manual" to switch it to Autonomous mode, and then click on "Disconnected" to connect.
